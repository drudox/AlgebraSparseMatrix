# AlgebraSparseMatrix

this is a set of class for the storage of Sparse Matrix (usefull when you deal with system of Parial differential equation )
All the classes are written in C++ 14. Sorry but all the class are implemented in the heder file 
(I Know... it is a very bad programming practice ) I will never change them :P .. I've just tried each one or two time !!
Doxygen is incomplete! (please don't care with me about :) )
