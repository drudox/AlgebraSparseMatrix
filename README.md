# AlgebraSparseMatrix

this is a set of class for the storage of Sparse Matrix (usefull when you deal with Parial differential equation system ) All the classes are written in C++ 14. Sorry but all the class are implemented in the heder file 
(I Know is very bad programming pratice ) but the class are written and left in a sort of testing version (I don't think I will change it ).. I've just tried each one just one time !!
Doxygen is almost incomplete ! please don't care with me about :) by the way now i'm just finisching my xmast vacation Maybe when I'll back in Glasgow if I will find a bit of time for improve the Doxygen I will!

The reason of this failings ( poor documentaions ... )  is that originally I developed this storage code (that now are C++ class ) for my University in-house Computational Fluid Dynamics Code written 
in FORTRAN 95 that I develops in my phD. 
Belive me (I love Fortran) but this storage is much more elegance written in a C++ OOP hierarchy (In the pdf file you'll all detail of hierarchy )



I wish to everybody all the best for the new year 2018 ! have fun , and don't hesitate to contact me ! 
Good Night :D
