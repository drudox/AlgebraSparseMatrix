# AlgebraSparseMatrix

I have just wrote a set of class for Storing Sparse Matrix (believe me very usefull when you deal with Parial differential equation system ) in all the way that I know :)  All the class are implemented in the heder file 
(I Know is very bad programming pratice ) but classes are still in testing .. I've just tried each one just one time !!
Doxygen is almost incomplete ! please don't care with me about :) by the way now i'm just finisching my xmast vacation :( please don't
feel down for me :P ) I promise you that when i'll back in Glasgow I gonna find a bit of time for improve all the class and i will write the
the Doxygen .. originally I developed  this code (now are C++ classes ) for in-house Computational Fluid Dynamics Code written 
in FORTRAN 95 that i develops but i can't publish it .. and belive me I love Fortran but this storage is much more elegance written in a C++ OOP hierarchy (In the pdf file you can see all the detail)



Well...   I wish everybody all the best for the new year 2018 ! have fun , and don't hesitate to contact me ! 
Good Night :D
