# AlgebraSparseMatrix

this is a set of class for the storage of Sparse Matrix (usefull when you deal with Parial differential equation system ) All the classes are written in C++ 14. Sorry but all the class are implemented in the heder file 
(I Know... it is a very bad programming practice ) but the class are written and left it in testing version (I will never change them :P ).. I've just tried each one or two time !!
Doxygen is incomplete! please don't care with me about :)
